The following procedure will help in resolving the DNS while working with DOCKER containers.

    # docker run busybox ping -c 2 192.203.230.10
    PING 192.203.230.10 (192.203.230.10): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 192.203.230.10: seq=0 ttl=56 time=66.724 ms
    64 bytes from 192.203.230.10: seq=1 ttl=56 time=54.786 ms
    --- 192.203.230.10 ping statistics ---
    2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max = 45.815/56.947/66.724 ms

When you try to ping to google.com using the container it fails to reach as it is unable to resolve the DNS.
   
    # docker run busybox nslookup google.com
    Server:    8.8.8.8
    Address 1: 8.8.8.8
    nslookup: can't resolve 'google.com'

Find out the DNS server used in your machine :

       # nm-tool  |grep DNS
        DNS:             172.24.100.50
        DNS:             10.1.100.50
        
Run it again using DNS IP found in the above step which resolves the DNS:

    # docker run --dns 172.24.100.50 busybox nslookup google.com
    Server:    172.24.100.50
    Address 1: 172.24.100.50 indc01.radisys.com
    Name:      google.com
    Address 1: 2607:f8b0:4009:80c::200e ord36s01-in-x0e.1e100.net
    Address 2: 172.217.4.110 ord36s04-in-f14.1e100.net
    
To resolve it permanently add the following content as below to a new file: 

    # cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
    {
        "dns" : ["172.24.100.50", "8.8.8.8"]
    }

More info on Docker DNS configuration : https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/configure-dns/

Restart the docker service :
    # sudo service docker restart
    docker stop/waiting
    docker start/running, process 22291
    root@labadmin-VirtualBox:/home/labadmin# docker run busybox nslookup google.com
    Server:    172.24.100.50
    Address 1: 172.24.100.50 indc01.radisys.com
    Name:      google.com
    Address 1: 2607:f8b0:4009:801::200e ord30s31-in-x0e.1e100.net
    Address 2: 172.217.4.238 ord30s31-in-f14.1e100.net

Check it by running the container:

    # docker run -it e02e811dd08f
    / # ping google.com
    PING google.com (172.217.4.238): 56 data bytes

    64 bytes from 172.217.4.238: seq=1 ttl=47 time=245.621 ms
